 * 10.2 Basic data types in ARM C and C++
 * Describes the basic data types implemented in ARM C and C++:
 *
 * Size and alignment of basic data types
 * The following table gives the size and natural alignment of the basic data types.
 * Table 10-2 Size and alignment of data types
 *
 * Type               & Size in bits & Natural alignment in bytes & Range of values
